## SNP wrappers for pacman & yay
## Note: `sudo pacman` bypasses snp. For operations which make changes, sudo is called
##       along with snp, so we don't need to `sudo pacman` anymore.
# Remove any existing pacman/yay aliases to avoid conflict with function definitions
unalias pacman 2>/dev/null
unalias yay 2>/dev/null

# Only define the smart wrappers if 'snp' is available in the PATH
if command -v snp >/dev/null 2>&1; then

  # pacman function: only wraps system-modifying commands with 'snp'
  pacman() {
    # Check if the first argument ($1) is a system-changing operation
    # The options below are for install, sync, upgrade, remove, and local upgrade operations
    case "$1" in
      -S|-Sy|-Syu|-Su|-Syyu|-Syy|-R|-U)
        # If so, run pacman under 'snp' to create pre/post Snapper snapshots
        command sudo snp pacman "$@"
        ;;
      *)
        # Otherwise, just run pacman normally (for search/query/etc)
        command pacman "$@"
        ;;
    esac
  }

  # yay function: same logic as above, for yay (AUR helper)
  yay() {
    case "$1" in
      -S|-Sy|-Syu|-Su|-Syyu|-Syy|-R|-U)
